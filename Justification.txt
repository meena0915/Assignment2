For handling missing values for the mileage, engine, power, new_price columns. I used median for imputation because mileage may have outliers that could skew the mean. The median provides a better central tendency measure. The mode is used here because seats is a categorical feature. Using the most frequent value makes sense in maintaining the typical car configuration in your analysis.
